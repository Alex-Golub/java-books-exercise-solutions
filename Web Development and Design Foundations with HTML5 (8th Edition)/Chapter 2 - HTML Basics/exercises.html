      A diagram of the organization of a website is called a
      <strong>site map</strong>. A site map represents the structure, or
      organization, of pages in a website in a visual manner. Creating the
      <strong>site map</strong> is one of the initial steps in developing a
      website.

    <h1>10. Favorite Recipe - Hummus</h1>
    <h2>You Will Need:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas or</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (250 grams) cooked chickpeas</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice (1 large lemon)</li>
      <li>
        1/4 cup (60 ml) well-stirred tahini, see our homemade tahini recipe
      </li>
      <li>1 small garlic clove, minced</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
      </li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin Salt to taste</li>
      <li>
        2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) water Dash ground paprika or sumac, for
        serving
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the bowl of a food processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice and
        process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then
        process for 30 seconds more. This extra time helps “whip” or “cream” the
        tahini, making the hummus smooth and creamy.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to
        the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for 30 seconds, scrape the
        sides and bottom of the bowl then process another 30 seconds or until
        well blended. Open, drain, and rinse the chickpeas. Add half of the
        chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape sides
        and bottom of the bowl, then add remaining chickpeas and process until
        thick and quite smooth; 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Most likely the hummus will be too thick or still have tiny bits of
        chickpea. To fix this, with the food processor turned on, slowly add 2
        to 3 tablespoons of water until you reach the perfect consistency.
      </li>

      <li>
        Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Serve hummus with a drizzle of
        olive oil and dash of paprika. Store homemade hummus in an airtight
        container and refrigerate up to one week.
