has different meaning and to accomplish this HTML uses elements that give sematic
structure to page content.


3. What role does W3C play in the implementation of HTML?

International community of member organizations that articulates web standards so that
websites look and work the same in all web browsers.
Its mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing standards,
protocols and guidelines that ensure its long-term growth.

=== ANS ===
1. Improving the Native Web
2. More Done with Less Code

5. What are nested HTML elements?
=== ANS ===
Elements that are within other HTML elements.
E.g. <body> element has all the visible content of the page and it contains all the other
HTML elements such as <header> <footer> etc.


6. What is semantic markup? Why is it important?
=== ANS ===

semantics, or meaning, of the content rather than its appearance.


7. Why is removing presentation-oriented markup from oneâ€™s HTML documents considered to
be a best practice?

8. What is the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?
What role does the doctype play with these modes?
=== ANS ===
In quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and
Internet Explorer 5.
In full standards mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the
HTML and CSS specifications.
In almost standards mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.

For HTML documents, browsers use a DOCTYPE in the beginning of the document to decide
whether to handle it in quirks mode or standards mode.
To ensure that your page uses full standards mode, make sure that your page has a DOCTYPE
