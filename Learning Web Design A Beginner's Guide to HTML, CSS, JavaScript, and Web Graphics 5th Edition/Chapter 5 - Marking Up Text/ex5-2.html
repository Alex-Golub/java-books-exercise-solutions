      <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
      <p>
        This week I am <em>extremely excited</em> about a new cooking technique
        called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn
        >. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually
        vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the
        target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,
        <cite>Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter</cite> describes it as
        ultra-low-temperature poaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
        Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before

        <strong>Warning</strong>: <i>Sous vide</i> cooked salmon is not
        pasteurized. Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.
