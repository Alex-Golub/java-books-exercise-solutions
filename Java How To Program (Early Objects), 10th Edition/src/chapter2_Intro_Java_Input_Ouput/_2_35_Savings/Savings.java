/**
 * 2.35 (Car-Pool Savings Calculator) Research several car-pooling websites.
 * Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost,
 * so that you can estimate how much money could be saved by
 * car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic
 * congestion.
 * The application should input the following information and display the userâ€™s cost per
 * day of driving to work:
 *      a) Total miles driven per day.
 *      b) Cost per gallon of gasoline.
 *      c) Average miles per gallon.
 *      d) Parking fees per day.
 *      e) Tolls per day.
