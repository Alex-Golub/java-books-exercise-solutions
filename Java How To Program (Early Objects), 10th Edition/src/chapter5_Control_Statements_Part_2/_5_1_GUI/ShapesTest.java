/**
 * 5.1 Draw 12 concentric circles in the center of a JPanel (Fig. 5.29).
 * The innermost circle should have a radius of 10 pixels, and each successive circle should have
 * a radius 10 pixels larger than the previous one.
 * Begin by finding the center of the JPanel.
 * To get the upper-left corner of a circle, move up one radius and to the left one radius from the center.
 * The width and height of the bounding rectangle are both the same as the circleâ€™s diameter (i.e., twice the radius).
