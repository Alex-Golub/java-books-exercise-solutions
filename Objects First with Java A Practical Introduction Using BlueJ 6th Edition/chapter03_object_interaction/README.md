> **_Divide and Conquer_** - divide the problem into sub-problems, then again
> into sub-sub-problems, and so on, until the individual problems are small enough
> to be easy to deal with.
> Once we solve one of the sub-problems, we do not think about the details of that part
> any more, but treat the solution as a single building block for our next problem.

> **_Abstraction_** is the ability to ignore details of parts, to focus attention on a higher
> level of a problem. (_E.g._ car consists of so many parts that it is practically
> impossible for a single person to know every detail about every part at the same time.)

> **_Modularization_** is the process of dividing a whole into well-defined parts that can
> be built and examined separately, and that interact in well-defined ways.

> **_Classes define types_** - A class name can be used as the type for a variable.
> When a variable stores an object, the object is not stored in the variable directly,  
> but rather an **_object reference_** is stored in the variable.

> The **_class diagram_** shows the classes of an application and the relationships between them.  
> It gives information about the source code and presents the `static view` of a program.

> The **_object diagram_** shows the objects and their relationships at one moment in time during  
> the execution (`runtime`) of an application.  
> It gives information about objects at runtime and presents the `dynamic view` of a program.

> The **_primitive types_** in ,Java are the non-object types.  
> Types such as `boolean`, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `char`, `double`, and `long` are the most common  
> primitive types. Primitive values are stored directly in a variable.  
> _Primitive types have no methods_.

> **_Object creation._** Objects can create other objects, using the `new` operator.

> **_Overloading._** A class may contain more than one constructor, or more than one method of the  
> same name, as long as each has a _distinctive set of parameter types_.

> Methods can call other methods of the same class as part of their implementation.  
> This is called an **_internal method call_**.
> An internal method call does not have a variable name (reference) and a dot before the method name
> **_this_** keyword can be used to reference the current object.
> **_NOTE:_** instance methods can call static methods (i.e. class methods) and also
> read class variables (static attributes). But the opposite is not possible.
> static methods can't invoke non-static methods and read non-static variables.

> Methods can call methods of other objects using **_dot notation_**  
> `object_reference.methodName(parameter-list)`.
> This is called an **_external method call_**.

> **_name overloading_**â€”the same name being used for two different entities.  
> fields and the parameters are separate variables that exist independently of each other,  
> even though they share similar names. The definition originating in the closest enclosing  
> block will always be used.
> **_this_** refers to the current object. `this.from` refers to the `from` field in the current
> object.

>
> > E.g. our `NumberDisplay` object `limit` is 24, invoking `setValue(42);` will result

> **Exercise 3.14** Write an expression using boolean variables `a` and `b` that

> **Exercise 3.17** Does the `getDisplayValue` method work correctly in all circumstances?  
> What assumptions are made within it?  
> What happens if you create a number display with `limit` 800, for instance?
>

> **Exercise 3.18** Is there any difference in the result of writing
> `return value + "";` rather than `return "" + value;` in the `getDisplayValue` method?
>
> > No, there isn't any difference.
> > `"" + value` is the same as `value + ""`, the result will be a String instance in both

> **Exercise 3.20** Explain the modulo (`%`) operator.
>
> > % operator will give back the reminder of of a division operation.
> > `n = q * d + r, 0 <= r < a` where q - quotient, r - reminder, d - divisor
> > % operator works for integer division (positive and negative)
> > and also for floating-point values.
> > **_NOTE:_** if dividend is negative then result will be negative remainder.
> > To work with positive reminders when dividend is negative we can use `Math.floorMod(int, int)`
> > or apply negative reminder e.g. -5 % 3 == -2 + 3 = 1

> **Exercise 3.21** What is the result of the expression (8 % 3) `== 2`?

> **Exercise 3.22** Try out the expression `(8 % 3)` in the Code Pad.  
> Try other numbers.  
> What happens when you use the modulo operator with negative numbers?
>
> > If dividend is negative we will get a negative result (negative reminder).
> > To convert it back to positive we should add the divisor.
> > E.g. 7 / 4 => q = 1, r = 3
> > (12 - 5) / 4 => r = -5 + 8 = 3

> **Exercise 3.23** What are all possible results of the expression **(n % 5)**, where
> n is a positive integer variable?
>
> > n % 5 => n = 5 \* q + r
> > => 0 <= r < 5
> > r Ïµ [0, 4]

> **Exercise 3.24** What are all possible results of the expression **(n % m)**, where
> n and m are positive integer variables?
>
> > `res Ïµ [0, m - 1]`

> **Exercise 3.25** Explain in detail how the `increment()` method works.
>
> > Each time `increment()` is invoked `NumberDisplay value` attribute will be incremented by 1  
> > only if the next value of it is less then `limit`.  
> > To achieve it % operator is used. If next value is limit then value is assigned 0.

> **Exercise 3.26** Rewrite the `increment` method without the modulo operator,  
> using an `if-statement`. Which solution is better?
>
> > Using % is better.
> >
> > ```java
> > public void increment() {
> >   if (value + 1 >= limit) value = 0;
> >   else value += 1;
> > }
> > ```

> **Exercise 3.27** Can you work out why it starts at that particular time?
>
> > `new ClockDisplay();` was used to create an instance of `ClockDisplay`.
> > Looking within the code we can see that the empty constructor creates two
> > instances of `NumberDisplay` which in its turn sets is initial values to zero.
> > Thus invoking `getTIme()` on `ClockDisplay()` will invoked the `getDisplayValue()` of each
> > of `NumberDisplay` objects which are zero at the beginning.

> **Exercise 3.29** How many times would you need to call the `timeTick` method
> on a newly created `ClockDisplay` object to make its time reach 01:00?
> How else could you make it display that time?
>
> > New instance of `ClockDisplay` starts at 00:00. We should call `timeTick` 60 times
> > To see the result 01:00.
> > Another way to change the `ClockDisplay` time is to use `setTime(int, int)` method
> > and set the time manually like so: `clock.setTime(1, 0);` upon invoking `getTime`  
> > we will get the string `"01:00"` back.

> **Exercise 3.30** Write ,Java statements that define a variable named `window` of
> type `Rectangle`, and then create a `Rectangle` object and assign it to that variable.  
> The `Rectangle` constructor has two `int` parameters.
>
> > ```java
> > Rectangle window = new Rectangle(5, 7); // assuming Rectangle(int width, int height)
> > ```

> **Exercise 3.31** Look at the second constructor in `ClockDisplay`â€™s source code.
> Explain what it does and how it does it.
>
> > ```java
> > /** Create instance of ClockDisplay with manual values for hour and minutes */
> > public ClockDisplay(int hour, int minute) {
> >  hours = new NumberDisplay(24);
> >  minutes = new NumberDisplay(60);
> >  setTime(hour, minute);
> > }
> >
> > /** Set current CLockDisplay hour and minutes objects with passed in hour and minute values */
> > public void setTime(int hour, int minute) {
> >  hours.setValue(hour);
> >  minutes.setValue(minute);
> >  updateDisplay();
> > }
> > ```

> **Exercise 3.32** Identify the similarities and differences between the two constructors.  
> Why is there no call to `updateDisplay` in the second constructor, for instance?
>
> > Both constructors create the same `hours` and `minutes` objects (repeating code)
> > 1st constructor is invoking `updateDisplay` right away because starting values
> > of `hours` and `minutes` are zero and there is no need the set them up with zero values.
> > On the other hand, 2nd constructor first must call `setTIme(int, int)` because the starting
> > time is different then the default ("00:00") thus in `setTIme(int, int)` `hours` and `minutes`  
> > are set to the passed-in `hour` and `minute` values to that constructor and only then `updateDisplay`  
> > is invoked (from `setTIme(int, int)`)
> >
> > ```java
> > public ClockDisplay() {
> >   hours = new NumberDisplay(24);
> >   minutes = new NumberDisplay(60);
> >   updateDisplay();
> > }
> >
> > public ClockDisplay(int hour, int minute) {
> >   hours = new NumberDisplay(24);
> >   minutes = new NumberDisplay(60);
> >   setTime(hour, minute);
> > }

> **Exercise 3.33** Given a variable `Printer p1;` which currently holds a reference to  
> a printer object, and two methods inside the `Printer` class with the headers:
> `public void print(String filename, boolean doubleSided)`  
> `public int getStatus(int delay)`  
> write two possible calls to each of these methods.

> **Exercise 3.34** Open the house project from Chapter 1 and review the `Picture` class.
> What types of object are created by the constructor of `Picture`?

> **Exercise 3.35** List all of the **_external method_** calls that are made in the `draw`
> method of `Picture` on the `Triangle` object called `roof`.

> **Exercise 3.36** Does the `Picture` class contain any **_internal method_** calls?
>
> > No. All methods calls are external.

> **Exercise 3.37** Remove the following two statements from the draw method of Picture:
> `window.changeColor("black");`  
> `sun.changeColor("yellow");`  
> and make the color setting, instead, via a single call to an internal method called

> **Exercise 3.40** Assume a class `Tree` has a field of type `Triangle` called  
> `leaves` and a field of type `Square` called `trunk`. The constructor of `Tree` takes
