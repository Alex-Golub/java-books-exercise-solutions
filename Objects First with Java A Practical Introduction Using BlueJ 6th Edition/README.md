## Progress and Objectives Covered

- [ ] [Part 1: Foundations of object orientation](https://bit.ly/3o50Rz4)
  - [x] **1. Objects and classes**
    - <details>
        <summary>Terms introduced in this chapter:</summary>
        object, class, instance, method, signature, parameter, type, state, source code,
        return value, compiler
      </details>
  - [x] [2. Understanding class definitions](https://bit.ly/3fHCnZo)
    - `Ticket-Machine` - A simulation of a ticket vending machine for train tickets;
    - `Book` - Storing details of a book.
    - `Heater` - Exercise
    - <details>
        <summary>Terms introduced in this chapter:</summary>
        field, instance variable, constructor, method, method header, method body,
        actual parameter, formal parameter, accessor, mutator, declaration, initialization,
        block, statement, assignment statement, conditional statement, return statement,
        return type, comment, expression, operator, variable, local variable, scope, lifetime
      </details>
  - [x] **3. Object interaction**
    - `Clock-display` - An implementation of a display for a digital clock; concepts of abstraction,
      modularization, and object interaction.
    - `Mail system` - A simple simulation of an email system.
    - <details>
        <summary>Terms introduced in this chapter:</summary>
        abstraction, modularization, divide and conquer, class diagram, object diagram,
        object reference, overloading, internal method call, external method call, dot
        notation, debugger, breakpoint
      </details>
  - [ ] **4. Grouping objects**
    - `Music-organizer` - introduce collections and loops. Includes the ability to play MP3 files.
    - `Auction` - More about collections and loops, this time with iterators.
  - [ ] **5. Functional Processing of Collections (Advanced)**
  - [ ] **6. More-sophisticated behavior**
  - [ ] **7. Fixed-size collections â€“ arrays**
  - [ ] **8. Designing classes**
  - [ ] **9. Well-behaved objects**
- [ ] **Part 2: Application structures**
  - [ ] **10. Improving structure with inheritance**
  - [ ] **11. More about inheritance**
  - [ ] **12. Further abstraction techniques**
  - [ ] **13. Building graphical user interfaces**
  - [ ] **14. Handling errors**
