This e-book has an unusual structure, being a compilation of eight
smaller books accompanied by eight related sets of _numbered_
explanatory notes provided by the author. It also contains several
hundred footnotes scattered throughout the text (many being Greek
spellings of words in the text). These have been given _alphabetic_
labels and are now grouped together as endnotes.

Numerous asterisks are present in parts of the text; these represent
uncertain quantities, not footnotes. The text also contains archaic
characters that may not display correctly with all viewing devices or
fonts. For best viewing, the deviceâ€™s character encoding should be set
to Unicode (UTF-8), and one of the following fonts selected: Arial
Unicode MS, DejaVu, Segoe UI Symbol or FreeSerif.

The text has been preserved as in the original, including inconsistent
punctuation, capitalisation and hyphenation. Archaic and
inconsistent spellings have been retained except where obviously
misspelled in the original. A list of these and other corrections has
been appended at the end.
