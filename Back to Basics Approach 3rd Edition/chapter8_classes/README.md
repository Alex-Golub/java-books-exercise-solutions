> 1. Describe the difference between **_`object-oriented`_** programming and **_`procedural`_** programming.
>    > Procedural programming treats a program as a sequence of actions or commands,  
>    > while object-oriented programming looks at a program as a group of interacting  
>    > entities named objects with related data and behavior.

> 2. What is an **_`object`_**?  
>     How is an object different from a `class`?
>    > An `object` is an entity that encapsulates related data and behavior,  
>    > while a `class` is the blueprint for a type of objects.

> 3. What is the state of a `String` object?  
>     What is its behavior?
>    > The state is its sequence of characters, and the behavior is its methods, such as  
>    > `length` and `indexOf`.

> 4. What is the output of the following program?
>    > `line 1 => 14 14`  
>    > `line 2 => 7 9 14 2`  
>    > `line 3 => 18 18`  
>    > `line 4 => 7 9 14 18`

> 5. Imagine that you are creating a class called `Calculator`.  
>     What state might a `Calculator` object have?  
>     What might its behavior be?
>    > The `state` might include the number that has just been computed and a memory feature.  
>    > The `behavior` might include methods to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and perhaps  
>    > advanced math operations such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.

> 6. Explain the differences between a **_`field`_** and a **_`parameter`_**.  
>     What is the difference in their syntax?  
>     What is the difference in their scope and the ways in which they may be used?
>    > - Field syntax differs because they can be declared with the 'private' keyword.
>    > - A field's scope is throughout the class, while a parameter's scope is limited to the method.
>    > - A field is a variable that exists inside of an object, while a parameter is a variable inside a method whose value is passed in from outside.

> 7. Create a class called `Name` that represents a personâ€™s name.  
>     The class should have fields representing the personâ€™s `first name`, `last name`, and  
>     `middle initial`.
>    > ```java
>    > public class Name {
>    >   String firstName;
>    >   String lastName;
>    >   char middleInitial;
>    > }
>    > ```

> 8. What is the difference between an **_`accessor`_** and a **_`mutator`_**?  
>     What naming conventions are used with accessors and mutators?
>    > An `accessor` provides the client access to data in the object,  
>    > while a `mutator` lets the client change the object's state.

> 9. Suppose we have written a class called `BankAccount` with a method inside it, defined as:
>    `public double computeInterest(int rate)`
>    If the client code has declared a `BankAccount` variable named `acct`,  
>     which of the following would be a valid call to the above method?
>    > ```java
>    > double result = computeInterest(acct, 42);    // âœ–, computeInterest is instance method
>    > acct.computeInterest(42.0, 15);               // âœ– expected 1 argument of type int here 2
>    > int result = BankAccount.computeInterest(42); // âœ– computeInterest is an instance method not static
>    > double result = acct.computeInterest(42);     // âœ” invoking computeInterest of BankAccount object
>    > new BankAccount(42).computeInterest();        // âœ– BankCount object may not have a constructor that receives value,
>    >                                               // more over passed 0 args expected 1
>    > ```

> 10. Add a new method to the `Point` class we developed in this chapter:
>     `public double distance(Point other)`
>     Returns the distance between the current `Point` object and the given other Point object.
>     > ```java
>     > public class Point {
>     >   int x;
>     >   int y;
>     >
>     >   public double distance(Point other) {
>     >     if (other == null || other.getClass() != this.getClass())
>     >       throw new IllegalArgumentException("argument is not a Ex8_1_quadrantPoint instance");
>     >
>     >     return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.x - other.x, 2) + Math.pow(this.y - other.y, 2));
>     >   }
>     > }
>     > ```

> 11. (You must complete Self-Check Problem 7 before answering this question.)
>     Add two new methods to the `Name` class:  
>     `public String getNormalOrder()`  
>     `public String getReverseOrder()`
>     > ```java
>     > public class Name {
>     >   String firstName;
>     >   String lastName;
>     >   char middleInitial;
>     >
>     >   public String getNormalOrder() {

>     >   }
>     > }
>     > ```

> 12. How do you write a class whose objects can easily be printed on the console?
>     > Define a **_`toString`_** method in the class.

> 13. The following println statement (the entire line) is equivalent to what?
>     > ```java
>     > Point p1 = new Point();
>     > // ...
>     > System.out.println(p1);
>     >
>     > System.out.println(toString(p1));     // âœ– toString is not static method of this class
>     > p1.toString();                        // âœ– toString returning a String object which is ignored
>     > System.out.println(p1.toString());    // âœ” println expects String which is what passed here
>     > System.out.println(p1.string());      // âœ– no such method as string in Ex8_1_quadrantPoint class
>     > System.out.println(Point.toString()); // âœ– toString is not static method of Ex8_1_quadrantPoint class
>     > ```

> 14. The `Point` class in the `java.awt` package has a `toString` method that returns a  
>      `String` in the following format: `java.awt.Point[x=7,y=2]`  
>      Write a modified version of the `toString` method on our `Point` class that returns  
>      a result in this format.
>     > ```java
>     > public class Point {
>     >   int x;
>     >   int y;
>     >
>     >   public double distance(Point other) {
>     >     if (other == null || other.getClass() != this.getClass())
>     >       throw new IllegalArgumentException("argument is not a Ex8_1_quadrantPoint instance");
>     >
>     >     return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(this.x - other.x, 2) + Math.pow(this.y - other.y, 2));
>     >   }
>     >
>     >   public String toString() {
>     >     return String.format("java.awt.%s[x=%d,y=%d]", getClass().getSimpleName(), x, y);
>     >   }
>     > }
>     > ```

> 15. Write a `toString` method for the `Name` class that returns a `String` such as `"John Q. Public"`.
>     > ```java
>     > public class Name {
>     >   String firstName;
>     >   String lastName;
>     >   char middleInitial;
>     >
>     >   public String getNormalOrder() {
>     >     return String.format("%s %c. %s", firstName, middleInitial, lastName);
>     >   }
>     >
>     >   public String getReverseOrder() {
>     >     return String.format("%s, %s %c.", lastName, firstName, middleInitial);
>     >   }
>     >
>     >   public String toString() {
>     >     return firstName + " " + middleInitial + ". " + lastName;
>     >   }
>     > }
>     > ```

> 16. Finish the following client code so that it constructs two `Point` objects,  
>      translates each, and then prints their coordinates.
>     > ```java
>     > public class PointClient {
>     >   public static void main(String[] args) {
>     >
>     >     // construct two Ex8_1_quadrantPoint objects, one at (8, 2) and one at (4, 3)
>     >     Point p1 = new Point(8, 2);
>     >     Point p2 = new Point(4, 3);
>     >
>     >     // display the two Ex8_1_quadrantPoint objects' state

> 17. What is a **_`constructor`_**?  
>      How is a constructor different from other methods?
>     > - A constructor is the code that is called when you use the `new` keyword.
>     > - A constructor is declared without a return type.
>     > - A constructor is a special method that creates an object and initializes its state.

> 18. What are two major problems with the following constructor?

> 22. What is **_`abstraction`_**?  
>      How do objects provide **_`abstraction`_**?
>     > - The ability to focus on a problem at a high level without worrying about the minor details.

>     > - Items declared public may be seen and used from any class,
