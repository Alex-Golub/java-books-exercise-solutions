/**
 * 3. Write a program that plays a guessing game with the user.
 * The program should generate a random number between 1
 * and some maximum (such as 100), then prompt the user repeatedly
 * to guess the number. When the user guesses incorrectly,
 * the game should give the user a hint about whether the correct
 * answer is higher or lower than the guess. Once the
 * user guesses correctly, the program should print a message showing
 * the number of guesses that the user made.
 * <p>
 * Consider extending this program by making it play multiple games
 * until the user chooses to stop and then printing
 * statistics about the playerâ€™s total and average number of guesses.
