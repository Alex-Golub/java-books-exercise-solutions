/**
 * 9. Write a method called printFactors that accepts an
 * integer as its parameter and uses a fencepost loop to print the
 * factors of that number, separated by the word "and".
 * For example, the factors of the number 24 should print as the following:
 * 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 6 and 8 and 12 and 24
 * You may assume that the parameterâ€™s value is greater than 0,
 * or you may throw an exception if it is 0 or negative.
 * Your method should print nothing if the empty string ("") is passed.
