/**
 * Write a recursive method named largestRectangleArea that accepts an
 * array of bar heights as its parameter and finds the largest rectangular
 * area that can be drawn in a contiguous region inside those bars.
 *
 * For example, if the bar heights are {1, 2, 1, 6, 5, 2, 3},
 * the bars could be thought of as follows:
 *
 *       #
 *       # #
 *       # #
 *       # #   #
 *   #   # # # #
 * # # # # # # #
 * 1 2 1 6 5 2 3
 *
 * The largest rectangle that can be made within these bars has
 * an area of 10 * (2 * 5):
 *
 *       #
 *      +---+
 *      |# #|
 *      |# #|
 *      |# #|  #
 *   #  |# #|# #
 * # # #|# #|# #
 *      +---+
 * 1 2 1 6 5 2 3
 *
 * 1. If the array is empty, return 0.
 * 2. If it contains only a single bar, return that bar's height.
