/**
 * Write a method named xRegions that accepts a rectangular 2-D
 * array of characters as a parameter, where every character in
 * the array is guaranteed to be either an uppercase 'X' or dash '-',
 * and modify its state so that any dashes or groups of dashes that are
 * ENTIRELY SURROUNDED by Xes in the original array will be changed
 * to 'X' themselves.
 *
 * 1. Your code should work for a board of any size,
 * even one with 0 rows or columns.
 *
 * 2. You may assume that the 2-D array is rectangular, that is,
 * that each row of the 2-D array contains the same number of columns.
 *
 * 3. You may assume that no characters appear in the board other
 * than 'X' and '-'.
