/**
 * Write a recursive method named mostWater that accepts an array
 * of vertical bar heights as its parameter and returns the largest
 * rectangular area of water that could be held in a contiguous region
 * between those bars.
 *
 * For example, if the bar heights are {2, 9, 6, 2, 4, 5, 8, 3, 7, 4},
 * the bars could be thought of as follows:
 *
 *   #
 *   #         #
 *   #         #   #
 *   # #       #   #
 *   # #     # #   #
 *   # #   # # #   # #
 *   # #   # # # # # #
 * # # # # # # # # # #
 * # # # # # # # # # #
 * 2 9 6 2 4 5 8 3 7 4
 *
 * The largest area of water that can be made within these
 * bars has an area of 49 (7 * 7):

 * 2 9 6 2 4 5 8 3 7 4
 * If the array contains fewer than 2 bars, return 0.
