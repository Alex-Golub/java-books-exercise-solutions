 *
 * Write a method named computeTax that accepts a salary as a parameter
 * and that returns the amount of tax you would owe if you make that salary.
 *
 * The tax is based on your tax bracket as found from the first two columns below.
 * Once you know which row to use, start with the "flat amount" and add the
 * "plus %" of the amount over the amount listed in the final column.
 *
 * For example, if your income is $50,000, then you use the third row of
 * the table and compute the tax as $4,000 plus 25% of the amount over $29,050,
 * which comes to $9,237.50.
 * The total tax on $27,500 is $3,767.50.
 * For $6,000, the tax is $600.
 * For $120,000, the tax is $28,227.
 * Assume your method is passed a value â‰¥ 0.
 *
 * over	   but not over flat amount plus % of excess over
 * $0      $7150        $0          10%    $0
 * $7150   $29050       $715        15%    $7150
 * $29050  $70350       $4000       25%    $29050
 * $70350  unlimited    $14325      28%    $70350
