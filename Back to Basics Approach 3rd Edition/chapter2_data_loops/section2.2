5.
Which of the following choices is the correct syntax for declaring a real
number variable named grade and initializing its value to 4.0?
a. int grade : 4.0;     // X, 4.0 is of type double and : is not assignment op
b. grade = double 4.0;  // X, double keyword is not in the right place
c. double grade = 4.0;  // ✔
d. grade = 4;           // X, double keyword missing
e. 4.0 = grade;         // X, reversed and no type


6.
Imagine you are writing a personal fitness program that stores the user’s age,
gender, height (in feet or meters), and weight (to the nearest pound or kilogram).
Declare variables with the appropriate names and types to hold this information.
=== ANS ===
int age;
String gender;
double height;
int weight;


7.
Imagine you are writing a program that stores a student’s year
(Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior), the number of courses the student
is taking, and his or her GPA on a 4.0 scale.
Declare variables with the appropriate names and types to hold this information.
=== ANS ===
String year;
int coursesTaken;
double gpa;


8.
Suppose you have an int variable called number.
What Java expression produces the last digit of the number (the 1s place)?
=== ANS ===
number % 10


9.
The following program contains 9 mistakes! What are they?
public class Oops2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x;                              // => no initialization
    System.out.println("x is"x);        // => incorrect string concatenation

    int x = 15.2;                       // => x has been already defined
    System.out.println("x is now + x"); // => x is part of the string, its value is not printed

    int y; // set y to 1 more than x    // => only declaration without assignment
    y = int x +1;                       // => incorrect place of int
    System.out.println("x and y are " + x + and + y); // => and is not defined
  }
}
=== ANS ===
Correct version of the code is:
public class Oops2 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 0;
    System.out.println("x is " + x);

    x = 15;
    System.out.println("x is now " + x);

    int y = x + 1; // set y to 1 more than x
    System.out.println("x and y are " + x + " and " + y);
  }
}
// x is 0
// x is now 15
// x and y are 15 and 16


10.
Suppose you have an int variable called number.
(a). What Java expression produces the second-to-last digit of the number (the 10s place)?
(b). What expression produces the third-to-last digit of the number (the 100s place)?
=== ANS ===
(a). number % 100 / 10
(b). number / 100 % 10


11.
What are the values of a, b, and c after the following statements?
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int c = b; // c = 10

a = a + 1; // => a = 6
b = b - 1; // => b = 9
c = c + a; // => c = 10 + 6 = 16


11.2
What is the value of variable x after the following code executes?

int x = 3;
x = x + 2; // x = 3 + 2 = 5
x = x + x; // x = 5 + 5 = 10


12.
What are the values of first and second at the end of the following code?
How would you describe the net effect of the code statements in this exercise?
int first = 8;
int second = 19;
first = first + second;  // first = 8 + 19 = 27
second = first – second; // second = 27 - 19 = 8
first = first – second;  // first = 27 - 8 = 19
=== ANS ===
The code will swap (int-place) the values between first and second
without using 3rd temp variable.


13.
Rewrite the code from the previous exercise to be shorter,
by declaring the variables together and by using the special
assignment operators (e.g., += , –=, *=, and /=) as appropriate.
=== ANS ===
int first = 8, second = 19;
first  += second;
second  = first - second;
first  -= second;


14.
What are the values of i, j, and k after the following statements?
int i = 2;
int j = 3;
int k = 4;
int x = i + j + k; // x = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

i = x - i - j;     // i = 9 - 2 - 3 = 4
j = x - j - k;     // j = 9 - 3 - 4 = 2
k = x - k - i;     // k = 9 - 4 - 4 = 1


15.
What is the output from the following code?
int max;
int min = 10;
max = 17 – 4 / 10;             // max = 17 - 0 = 17
max = max + 6;                 // max = 17 + 6 = 23
min = max – min;               // min = 23 - 10 = 13
System.out.println(max * 2);   // => 46
System.out.println(max + min); // => 36
System.out.println(max);       // => 23
System.out.println(min);       // => 13


16.
Suppose you have a real number variable x.
Write a Java expression that computes the following value y while using
the * operator only four times:
y = 12.3x^4 - 9.1x^3 + 19.3x^2 - 4.6x + 34.2
=== ANS ===
double y = 12.3 * Math.pow(x, 4) - 9.1 * Math.pow(x, 3)
           + 19.3 * Math.pow(x, 2) - 4.6 * x + 34.2


17.
The following program redundantly repeats the same expressions many times.
Modify the program to remove all redundant expressions using variables
of appropriate types.
public class ComputePay {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Calculate pay at work based on hours worked each day
    int hoursWorked = 4 + 5 + 8 + 4;
    System.out.println("My total hours worked:");
    System.out.println(hoursWorked);

    double hourlySalary = 8.75;
    System.out.println("My hourly salary:");
    System.out.println("$" + hourlySalary);

    double totalPay = hoursWorked * hourlySalary;
    System.out.println("My total pay:");
    System.out.println(totalPay);

    double tax = 0.20;
    System.out.println("My taxes owed:"); // 20% tax
    System.out.println(totalPay * tax);
  }
}


18.
The following program redundantly repeats the same expressions many times.
Modify the program to remove all redundant expressions using variables
of appropriate types.
// This program computes the total amount owed for a meal,
// assuming 8% tax and a 15% tip.
public class Receipt {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Subtotal:");
    int subtotal = 38 + 40 + 30;
    System.out.println(subtotal);

    System.out.println("Tax:");
    double tax = .08;
    System.out.println((subtotal) * tax);

    System.out.println("Tip:");
    double tip = (subtotal) * .15;
    System.out.println(tip);

    System.out.println("Total:");
    double total = 38 + 40 + 30 + (subtotal) * tax + tip;
    System.out.println(total);
  }
}
